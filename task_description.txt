Setup a similar docker-compose (found in this folder) to how weaviate does it but for chromadb

NOTES:
Main chroma service can be instantiated with the official docker image like they do in their
docker compose here: https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/blob/main/docker-compose.yml
A service is needed for the sentencetransformers model that does the inference

task 1
======
take as example the provided embedding function for bge and create a
sentencetransformer service with 2 endpoints:

1. inference endpoint like this
@app.post("/v1/embed")
def embed(texts: Documents) -> Embeddings:

2. healthcheck endpoint to see if service is running
@app.get("/health")
def healthcheck():
    return "ok"

task 2
======
create a docker image of the above service and 
test the functionality (post some documents and get vector representations)

task 3
======
modify the embedding function for bge to actually call (make a post request with list of strings/text in body) the  
sentencetransformers service and use it in a python script to check functionality

task 4
======
create a collection with ChromaHttpClient using the modified embedding function you created in task 3
